## Production Notes

1. **Pacing**: Allow natural pauses between scenes
2. **Tone**: Professional but approachable, enthusiastic but not salesy
3. **Music**: Light, upbeat background music (royalty-free)
4. **Transitions**: Smooth fades between scenes

## Recording Tips

- Record in a quiet environment
- Use a pop filter to reduce plosives
- Maintain consistent distance from microphone
- Record each scene separately for easier editing
